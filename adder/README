# Tiny Web Server

This is the home directory for the **Tiny server**, a 200-line Web server used in _15-213: Intro to Computer Systems_ at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Tiny uses the GET method to serve:

- **Static content** (text, HTML, GIF, JPG) served from the current directory (`./`)
- **Dynamic content** generated by CGI programs in the `./cgi-bin` directory

The default page is `home.html` (not `index.html`) to allow directory listing via browser.

üìù For more details, refer to Section 11.6, "Putting It Together: The Tiny Web Server," in the textbook _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)_.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Tiny is **neither secure nor complete**, but gives students an idea of how a real web server works. Use for **instructional purposes only**.

The code compiles and runs cleanly using **GCC 2.95.3** on a **Linux 2.2.20** kernel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

In a clean directory, run:

```bash
tar xvf tiny.tar
```

---

## üöÄ Running Tiny

```bash
./tiny <port>
```

Example:

```bash
./tiny 8000
```

Then point your browser to:

- Static content: `http://<host>:8000`
- Dynamic content: `http://<host>:8000/cgi-bin/adder?1&2`
